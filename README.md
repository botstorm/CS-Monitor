<h1>CS Monitor</h1>
<h2>What's CS monitor?</h2>
<p>Monitor - a platform application that provides the ability to view the register of public transactions (transfers).
The CS monitor is a web-based version of the application that provides the ability to view the public transfer register. The monitor is implemented in C# and connects to the peer-to-peer network using the platform API. Statistics are updated every second.
The CS monitor page contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of nodes in the network</li>
<li>Transaction statistics</li>
<li>Balance</li>
<li>Detailing the transactions of the selected wallet</li>
<li>General information on the smart contract</li>
<li>An overview of the open smart contract</li>
</ul>
<p>The monitor is implemented on the basis of the Node architecture. To provide up-to-date information, the Monitor receives information about all the changes in the blocks, but does not participate in the rounds.</p>
